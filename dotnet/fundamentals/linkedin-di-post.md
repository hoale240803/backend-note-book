# Dependency Injection in .NET: A Comprehensive Guide 🚀

Dependency Injection (DI) is a crucial design pattern in .NET development. Let me break down the key concepts and best practices! 👇

## 🔍 What is Dependency Injection?

DI implements Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies, creating loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable applications.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is a Dependency?
A dependency is an object that another object depends on. For example:

```csharp
public class MyDependency
{
    public void WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"MyDependency.WriteMessage called. Message: {message}");
    }
}
```

### Why Use DI?
• Reduces tight coupling
• Centralizes configuration
• Makes testing easier
• Improves maintainability

## ⏱️ Service Lifetimes

1. **Transient**
   • Created each time requested
   • Best for lightweight services
   • Example: `services.AddTransient<IService, Service>();`

2. **Scoped**
   • Created once per request
   • Shared within a single request
   • Example: `services.AddScoped<IService, Service>();`

3. **Singleton**
   • Created once, shared throughout app
   • Best for stateful services
   • Example: `services.AddSingleton<IService, Service>();`

## 🛠️ Implementation Example

```csharp
// Interface
public interface IMyDependency
{
    void WriteMessage(string message);
}

// Implementation
public class MyDependency : IMyDependency
{
    public void WriteMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"MyDependency.WriteMessage Message: {message}");
    }
}

// Registration
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyDependency, MyDependency>();
```

## 💎 Best Practices

• Use constructor injection
• Register services in Program.cs
• Choose appropriate lifetimes
• Avoid service locator pattern
• Implement proper disposal

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

• Capturing scoped services in singletons
• Calling BuildServiceProvider in ConfigureServices
• Static access to HttpContext
• Overusing singleton pattern

## 💡 Recommendations

1. Start with constructor injection
2. Use interfaces for dependencies
3. Keep services focused and small
4. Use appropriate lifetime scopes
5. Write unit tests for services
6. Monitor service lifetime
7. Use logging for tracking
