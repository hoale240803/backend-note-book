1. What is ASP.NET?
ASP.NET (Active Server Pages . NET) is a progressive new programming framework that empowers the rapid improvement of powerful web applications and administrations. It is a part of the Microsoft .NET Platform, it gives the simplest and most versatile approach to creating, deploying and running web applications that can focus on any browser or device.ASP.NET is built on the CLR(Common Language Runtime) which allows the programmers to execute its code using any .NET language(C#, VB, etc.). It is specially designed to work with HTTP and for web developers to create dynamic web pages, web applications, websites, and web services as it provides a good integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

.NET Framework is used to create a variety of applications and services like Console, Web, and Windows, etc. But ASP.NET is only used to create web applications and web services. That’s why we termed ASP.NET as a subset of the .NET Framework.

2. What is ASP.NET MVC framework?
ASP.MVC is a web application framework that is lightweight and has high testable features. ASP.NET supports 3 different types of components namely Model, View, and Controller.

Model Layer: The Model component corresponds to all or any of the data-related logic that the user works with. This will represent either the info that’s being transferred between the View and Controller components or the other business logic-related data. For instance, a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database, manipulate it, and update its data back to the database or use it to render data.
View Layer: The View component is employed for all the UI logic of the appliance. For instance, the Customer view will include all the UI components like text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the ultimate user interacts with.
Controller: Controllers act as an interface between Model and consider components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component, and interact with the Views to render the ultimate output. For instance, the Customer controller will handle all the interactions and inputs from the Customer View and update the database using the Customer Model. An equivalent controller is going to be wont to view the Customer data.

3. What is the web.config file?
A configuration file (web.config) is utilized to oversee different settings that characterize a website. The settings are store in XML files that are independent of your application code. In this manner, you can configure settings freely from your code. This file stored inside the application root directory.

4. What is the difference between custom controls and user controls?

5. What are web controls in ASP.NET?
Web server controls are powerful than HTML server-side controls. The only difference is that they must have the runat = ”server” attribute set. This attribute makes the control available for server-side programming. Each ASP.NET Server Control is capable of exposing an object model containing properties, methods, and events. This object model can be utilized by the ASP.NET developers to modify and interact with the Web page. Web controls contain all basic controls of HTML controls as well as some new controls like as DataGrid, DataList, and Calendar.
