| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **0** (`version: 1`)          | Declares build-spec schema version. Needed so Amplify parses keys correctly.              | Only `1` is valid today.                                                                              | ([AWS Documentation][1]) |
| **0.1** (`frontend:`)         | Top-level section for SPA / static sites.                                                 | Back-end resources (GraphQL, Auth, etc.) have their own section if used.                              | ([AWS Documentation][1]) |
| **1** (`cd devops/front-end`) | Move the build context into the folder that **contains package.json**.                    | If you skip this, Amplify runs `npm` in repo root and throws the `ENOENT package.json` error you saw. | ([AWS Documentation][2]) |
| **2** (`npm ci`)              | Installs exact versions from `package-lock.json`.                                         | Faster and reproducible; cache step (‚ë•) keeps the folder for next build.                              | ([AWS Documentation][1]) |
| **3** (`npm run build`)       | Executes the script that generates static assets (React ‚Üí `build/`, Vue ‚Üí `dist/`, etc.). | Must output an **`index.html`**; Amplify serves whatever lands in ‚ë£.                                  | ([AWS Documentation][3]) |
| **4** (`baseDirectory`)       | Path (relative to repo root) that now **contains your build artifacts** after step 3.     | If this is wrong you‚Äôll get the ‚ÄúWelcome/first deployment‚Äù placeholder.                               | ([AWS Documentation][4]) |
| **5** (`files`)               | Glob patterns to upload. `**/*` grabs everything in ‚ë£.                                    | Narrow it (e.g., `*.html`, `static/**`) for smaller uploads if needed.                                | ([AWS Documentation][1]) |
| **6** (`cache.paths`)         | Directories persisted between builds to speed up `npm ci`.                                | Path must be relative to repo root (same as ‚ë† after `cd`).                                            | ([AWS Documentation][1]) |
