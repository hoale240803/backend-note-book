# 1. Develop Azure compute solutions

In this track of the az-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure journey, the focus will be on the following:

- Implement containerized solutions
- Implement Azure App Service Web Apps
- Implement Azure Functions

## 1.1 Virtual machines

### Discover the key concepts covered in this course

- Create and manage Azure VMs using a variety of tools and techniques, including the Azure CLI, Azure Portal, and Azure PowerShell

- Learn about the basics of Azure VMs and how to create and configure both Linux and Windows VMs in Azure.

- Discuss how to connect to your VMs using various methods, including SSH and Secure Shell(SSH) on Linux VMs and Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP) on Windows VMs.

- Cover how to use SSH public-private key pairs

### Outline the use of virtual machines (VMs) in Azure

- Virtualization/emulation of a physical computer system. E.g a digital version of a physical computer

- Runs on an isolated partition of its host computer with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage.

- Ideal when seeking more control over the computing environment

- Enables virtualization without having to purchase or maintain the physical hardware used to operate virtual machines

- Configuring, Patching, Installing

**Use cases**

- Development & testing
- Applications
- Datacenter

**Considerations**

- Resource locations
- Virtual machine sizes
- Maximum number of virtual machines
- Virtual machine configuration(s)

**Locations to create or access resources**

- Azure portal
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- REST API

**Availability**

- Availability zones
- Virtual machine scale sets

**Pricing Factors**

- Processing power: the more cpu, thee more the cost.
- Memory: the same processing power
- Storage capacity: larger is more expensive
- Network bandwidth

**Core Limitations**

- The main quota is that you can have a maximum of 20 VMs per subscription

**Managed data disks**

- CLI, PowerShell

### Create a Linux VM with Azure CLI

Azure Linux VM Demo Summary
This guide summarizes the key steps and takeaways from a demo on creating a Linux VM using Azure CLI, installing an Nginx web server, and verifying its functionality by accessing it via a browser.
Key Takeaways
Prerequisites

Active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.
Latest Azure CLI installed (Azure CLI Installation).
PowerShell or terminal for running Azure CLI commands.
SSH client for VM access.

Step-by-Step Process

Log in to Azure CLI:

Command: `az login`
Action: Authenticate via browser to connect CLI to your Azure account.
Note: Ensure you're logged in for all CLI operations.

Create a Resource Group:

Command: `az group create --name sbdemo0103 --location eastus`
Purpose: Create a logical container (sbdemo0103) in the eastus region for Azure resources.
Tip: Choose a region close to your location.

Create a Linux VM:

Command:

```
az vm create \
 --resource-group sbdemo0103 \
 --name sbdemo0103 \
 --image debian \
 --admin-username azureuser \
 --generate-ssh-keys \
 --public-ip-sku Standard
 --size Standard_B1s
 --location eastus
```

Details:
Creates a Debian-based VM named sbdemo0103 in the sbdemo0103 resource group.
Uses azureuser as the admin username.
Generates SSH keys for secure access.
Assigns a standard public IP address.

Output: Save the public IP address (e.g., 20.124.50.242) for later use.

Install Nginx Web Server:

Command:

```
az vm run-command invoke \
 --resource-group sbdemo0103 \
 --name sbdemo0103 \
 --command-id RunShellScript \
 --scripts "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
```

Purpose: Runs a shell script on the VM to update packages and install Nginx.

![installed nginx](image-1.png)
Open Port 80:

Command: `az vm open-port --resource-group sbdemo0103 --name sbdemo0103 --port 80`
Purpose: Allows HTTP traffic to the VM to access the Nginx web server.

Verify Web Server:

Action: Open a browser and navigate to the VMâ€™s public IP (e.g., http://20.124.50.242).
Expected Result: Displays the "Welcome to nginx!" page, confirming the VM and web server are operational.

![opened port 80](image-2.png)
![worked](image-3.png)
Clean Up Resources:

Command: `az group delete --name sbdemo0103 --no-wait --yes --verbose`
Purpose: Deletes the resource group and all associated resources (VM, public IP, etc.) to avoid costs.
Note: Deletion may take a few minutes.

Additional Notes

Resource Group: Acts as a logical folder for organizing Azure resources.
SSH Keys: Automatically generated during VM creation for secure Linux VM access.
Public IP: Essential for external access to the VM (e.g., via SSH or browser).
Cost Management: Always delete unused resources to prevent unnecessary charges.

Quick Reference

Login: az login
Resource Group: `az group create --name <name> --location <region>`

Create VM: `az vm create --resource-group <name> --name <vm-name> --image debian --admin-username <username> --generate-ssh-keys --public-ip-sku Standard`

Install Software: `az vm run-command invoke --resource-group <name> --name <vm-name> --command-id RunShellScript --scripts "<linux-commands>"`

Open Port: `az vm open-port --resource-group <name> --name <vm-name> --port 80`

Delete Resources: `az group delete --name <name> --no-wait --yes --verbose`
